CDP curates and supports the Master in Games at ITU University of Copenhagen:

Based on a solid foundation of creative, technical, social, and analytical competences, you will realize the playful experiences of tomorrow. By understanding the complex creative process of game production, and how professional development teams work together, you will be able to make a difference in any project that uses game technology or playful design elements.
 
The MSc in Games is as much about making as it is about understanding. It provides you with practical and theoretical knowledge on how computer games are made, how they create meaning, and how they impact our social interactions and communities. You will work with some of the worldâ€™s leading games researchers, explore cutting edge technologies for their playful potential, and become an expert in how to realize creative projects in interdisciplinary teams. You will learn how to use design methods, technical experimentation, analytical tools, critical thinking, and scientific research to drive innovation.
